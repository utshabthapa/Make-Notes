## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### **Frontend**

- **React.js** - UI library
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Axios** - HTTP client
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Icons** - Icon library
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server

### **Backend**

- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **MySQL2** - Database driver
- **JWT** - Authentication tokens
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing
- **Swagger** - API documentation

### **Database**

- **MySQL** - Relational database

## üèóÔ∏è Engineering Decisions

### **Database Implementation: MySQL**

MySQL was specified in the project requirements. Coming from a background of primarily working with NoSQL databases like MongoDB in previous MERN projects, this provided valuable experience with relational databases:

- **Schema design** with proper normalization for users, notes, and categories
- **Foreign key relationships** ensuring data integrity across related entities
- **Complex queries** with JOINs for fetching notes with their associated categories
- **Transaction management** for operations involving multiple tables

### **API Documentation with Swagger**

Implementing comprehensive API documentation was a new concept that significantly enhanced the development workflow:

- **Interactive documentation** allowing direct API testing from the browser
- **Schema validation** ensuring request/response consistency
- **Development efficiency** by providing clear endpoint specifications
- **Professional standards** following industry best practices for API documentation
- **Team collaboration** enabling easier frontend-backend integration

### **Authentication Strategy**

- **JWT with HTTP-only cookies** instead of localStorage for enhanced XSS protection
- **bcrypt password hashing** with appropriate salt rounds for security
- **Middleware-based route protection** ensuring consistent authentication across endpoints
- **Session management** with configurable token expiration

### **Frontend Architecture**

- **Component-based design** with reusable UI components for maintainability
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid development and consistent design system
- **Responsive-first approach** ensuring mobile compatibility across all screen sizes
- **State management** using React hooks for simplicity without over-engineering

### **Soft Delete Implementation**

- **Archive functionality** instead of permanent deletion for better user experience
- **Separate archived content management** with restore capabilities
- **Data preservation** allowing users to recover accidentally deleted items
- **Clean separation** between active and archived content in the UI

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16.0.0 or higher)
- **MySQL Server** (v8.0 or higher)
- **npm** package manager
- **Git**

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### **1. Clone the Repository**

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/utshabthapa/Make-Notes.git
cd Make-Notes
\`\`\`

### **2. Database Setup**

#### **Using MySQL Workbench (Recommended)**

1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Connect to your MySQL server
3. Open the SQL script file: `Backend/database/Make-Notes-Schema.sql`
4. Execute the entire script to create the database and tables

#### **Using MySQL Command Line**

\`\`\`bash

# Login to MySQL

mysql -u root -p

# Create database and tables

source Backend/database/Make-Notes-Schema.sql
\`\`\`

### **3. Backend Setup**

\`\`\`bash

# Navigate to backend directory

cd Backend

# Install dependencies

npm install
\`\`\`

#### **Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory:

\`\`\`env

# Database Configuration

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=make_notes

# JWT Configuration

JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_make_it_long_and_random
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=30d
JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN=2592000000

# Server Configuration

PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URL (for CORS)

FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
\`\`\`

**Important:** Replace `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL password and generate a strong JWT secret.

### **4. Frontend Setup**

\`\`\`bash

# Navigate to frontend directory (from project root)

cd Frontend

# Install dependencies

npm install
\`\`\`

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### **Start Backend Server**

\`\`\`bash

# From Backend directory

npm run dev

# Server will start on http://localhost:5000

\`\`\`

### **Start Frontend Development Server**

\`\`\`bash

# From Frontend directory (in a new terminal)

npm run dev

# Frontend will start on http://localhost:5173

\`\`\`

## üìö API Documentation

Once the backend server is running, you can access the comprehensive API documentation at:

**üîó [http://localhost:5000/api-docs](http://localhost:5000/api-docs)**

The Swagger UI provides detailed information about all available endpoints, request/response schemas, and allows you to test the API directly from the browser.

### **Frontend Access**

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## üîç Assumptions Made During Development

### **User Behavior Assumptions**

- **Single-user focus**: Each user manages their personal notes without sharing or collaboration features
- **Category organization**: Users will create a reasonable number of categories (5-50) for organizing their notes
- **Content type**: Notes will primarily contain text-based content with occasional formatting needs
- **Usage patterns**: Users will access the application regularly but not require real-time collaborative features

### **Technical Assumptions**

- **Browser compatibility**: Users have modern browsers supporting ES6+ features and local storage
- **Network stability**: Reasonably stable internet connection for API communication
- **Device usage**: Primary usage on desktop/laptop computers with secondary mobile device access
- **Data scale**: Individual users will manage 10-1000 notes without requiring complex pagination strategies

### **Business Logic Assumptions**

- **Note ownership**: Notes belong exclusively to their creator with no sharing mechanisms
- **Category flexibility**: Users can assign multiple categories to notes and modify them freely
- **Archive behavior**: Archived items should be easily recoverable but separated from active content
- **Search scope**: Search functionality covers note titles and content but not metadata like creation dates
